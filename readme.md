## install

```sh
yarn add open-pip
```

## Usage

```js
const open = require('open-pip')

open('/path/to/movie.mp4')
  .then(() => console.log('Worked ðŸŽ‰'))
  .catch(error => console.log('Something went wrong ðŸ’€', error))
```

### How does it work?

It uses child-process-promise to run this command:
```sh
open pip.app --args <absolute-path-to-file>
```

pip.app is a simple macOS app that reads the input argument and tries to load it in an AVPlayer
